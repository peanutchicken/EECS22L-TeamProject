# Terminal-based Chess Game
This is the Final Release version of the Chess Program written by the Electric Lizards (Team 03) for EECS22L. This program supports all rules of Chess and provides a platform to users to learn how to play chess in a computer-based format. The game is contained inside a completely text based format, all played inside a terminal window. 

This game has been written for compatibility with the UCI EECS Linux servers (running CentOS 6.10). It is built using the C99 ANSI standard, but your mileage may vary with compilation on other hardware.
