# Terminal-based Multiplayer Chess Game
This is the Beta Release version of the Chess Program written by the Electric Lizards (Team 03) for EECS22L. This program has chess playing functionality. We weren't able to complete the accounts, or friends functionality. Messaging within the game works.

This game has been written for compatibility with the UCI EECS Linux servers (running CentOS 6.10). It is built using the C99 ANSI standard, but your mileage may vary with compilation on other hardware.
