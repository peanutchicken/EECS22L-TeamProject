# Terminal-based Multiplayer Chess Game
This is the Alpha Release version of the Chess Program written by the Electric Lizards (Team 03) for EECS22L. This program is a preliminary version of how our server will work, and currently allows for a client to connect and login to the server. It is currently not compatible with the chess game code, but compability is in the works and will be working shortly. 

This game has been written for compatibility with the UCI EECS Linux servers (running CentOS 6.10). It is built using the C99 ANSI standard, but your mileage may vary with compilation on other hardware.
